# ModelBuilder
## Official docs

Free to use fullstack application.
The ModelBuilder mocks the official Spring starter - 
basically, you can generate new applications with pre-implemented Spring and Maven dependencies.
So.. why using ModelBuilder you ask? 
Since it also contains the ability to generate custom classes, which already implements Ctors, Setters and Getters.
Also, as a authenticated user, you can archive the projects you generate and re-generate them again in the feture.
Last but not least - with ModelBuilder, you can auto generate repositories for each custom class you create & declare as entity.
